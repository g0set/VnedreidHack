Our team took part in a hackathon held on June 7–8. We worked on Kubernetes optimization and took second place in our track. The project is fully open source.

My task in the project was to develop the frontend and configure part of the pods. I also participated in integrating with a microservice that executed the main commands for interacting with Kubernetes and adjusted pod load based on AI recommendations.

Below is the presentation of our project.
